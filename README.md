## Online or offline

**Use it online**

âž¡ [Open this online](https://verlok.github.io/ooo)

It also takes parameters from the URL:

- immediateEmail (another person's email)
- signature (typically your name)
- urgentPhone (the phone number you want to be reached at)
- accessToEmail (pass `yes` if you have access to your email)

Example URL:

```
https://verlok.github.io/ooo/?immediateEmail=workmate.buddy@domain.com&signature=Your+Name
```

You can store the composed URL in your browser's bookmarks, to **avoid filling your data each time**.

**Or use it offline**

It's a single HTML file, so you can download it, edit it as you wish, and even send it to others.
