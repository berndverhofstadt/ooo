Automatically generate your out of office messages. Ready to copy and paste.

## Online or offline

**Use it online**

âž¡ [Open this online](https://verlok.github.io/ooo)

It also takes parameters from the URL:

- `immediateEmail` - another person's email, e.g. `workmate@company.com`
- `signature` - typically your name, e.g `signature=John+Doe`
- `urgentPhone` - the phone number you want to be reached at, e.g. `+39.321.1234567`
- `accessToEmail` - pass `yes` if you'll have access to your email, any other value (or nothing) if you won't

Example URL:

```
https://verlok.github.io/ooo/?immediateEmail=workmate.buddy@domain.com&signature=Your+Name
```

You can store the composed URL in your browser's bookmarks, to **avoid filling your data each time**.

**Or use it offline**

It's a single HTML file, so you can download it, edit it as you wish, and even send it to others.
